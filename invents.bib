   abstract = {Described herein are optoelectronic devices and methods incorporating strain balanced direct bandgap AlxIn1-xP multiple quantum wells. The described devices are strain balanced in that the net strain between the ordered quantum wells and barriers is low, or in some cases zero. Advantageously, the described devices may be specifically designed for higher efficiency than existing AlxIn1-xP and may be grown on commercially available GaAs substrates.
