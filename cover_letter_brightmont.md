Hiring Manager
Brightmont Academy
Broomfield, CO

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Part-Time Math and Science Teacher position at Brightmont Academy in Broomfield. With a Ph.D. in Physics, 15 years of university teaching experience, 

I have 15 years of experience delivering instruction to individual students and small groups at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I have often found one-on-one instruction to be particularly effective and rewarding and am excited about the opportunity to help students achieve mastery in mathematics and science through personalized, individualized teaching.

**Why I'm the Ideal Fit**

What drew me to this position is Brightmont Academy's commitment to tailored, one-on-one instruction—an approach I have practiced and refined throughout my teaching career. At South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, I spent 15 years delivering individualized instruction to graduate and undergraduate students, assessing each student's unique learning style and adapting my methods accordingly. Whether working with visual learners who benefit from diagrams and demonstrations, hands-on learners who need tactile engagement with concepts, or analytical learners who thrive on step-by-step problem-solving, I have consistently helped students overcome learning barriers and build genuine understanding.

My teaching approach aligns perfectly with Brightmont Academy's gradual release methodology. I believe in scaffolding instruction—starting with guided support and gradually building student independence as they demonstrate understanding and confidence. This patient, empathetic approach has proven successful with diverse learners, including students who have struggled in traditional classroom settings. I take pride in meeting students where they are academically and helping them discover that they can master challenging STEM concepts when given the right support.

**Relevant Skills and Experience**

- **Subject Expertise:** Ph.D. in Physics with deep knowledge across Mathematics (Algebra through Calculus), Physics (all levels), Chemistry, and Engineering—covering the full range of subjects Brightmont Academy students may need
- **One-on-One Teaching:** Extensive experience providing individual mentorship to graduate students and 10 cohorts of NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates participants, tailoring guidance to each student's needs
- **Technology Proficiency:** Comfortable with G-Suite and Learning Management Systems (Blackboard, Canvas), having used these tools throughout my teaching career for course delivery and student engagement
- **Location:** Based in Arvada, just minutes from Brightmont Academy's Broomfield location, ensuring reliable attendance and scheduling flexibility

**Why This Role Excites Me**

After 15 years in university teaching, I am eager to return to what I love most: direct, individualized instruction focused purely on student learning. The opportunity to teach without lesson planning, parent conferences, or grading obligations is highly appealing—it allows me to concentrate entirely on what matters: helping each student achieve mastery. The part-time nature (approximately 20 hours weekly) fits perfectly with my current availability, and I am comfortable with flexible scheduling to accommodate student needs.

I am genuinely passionate about making STEM subjects accessible and engaging. There is nothing more rewarding than the moment when a struggling student suddenly "gets it"—when confusion transforms into understanding and confidence. I would welcome the opportunity to bring this passion and experience to Brightmont Academy's students.

I would be delighted to discuss how my background and teaching philosophy align with Brightmont Academy's mission. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at 720-988-6627 or spahrenk@gmail.com. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Scott Phillip Ahrenkiel
