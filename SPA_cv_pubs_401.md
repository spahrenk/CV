**Employment**

***[SPAhrenTech](https://spahrentech.com/), Coloradolorado (self-employed), Golden, Colorado***

* I develop physics-based [software](https://github.com/orgs/SPAhrenTech/repositories) inspired by both my research interests and entertainment. I have vast experience in materials analysis using transmission electron microscopy, and I am deeply familiar with nano- materials, electronics, and characterization.

***[Big Ladder Software](https://bigladdersoftware.com/), Denver, Colorado***  
Computational Scientist (Jun. 2023-Oct. 2025\)

* My main project was development of a heat-pump-water-heater simulation [library](https://github.com/bigladder/HPWHsim) used by the California Energy Commission for compliance calculations. I generalized and restructured large segments of the code, with emphasis on physical rigor, while maintaining hundreds of unit and function tests. I implemented a formal data representation to allow external entry of manufacturer models as JSON. I added independently an interactive suite of graphical analysis apps using [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/), used to refine simulation parameters for new manufacturer models, and created a header-only [library](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/unity) for a physical-units agnostic API.

* I created a [data-conversion library](https://github.com/bigladder/CUACToolMiner) for users of the legacy California Utility Allowance Calculator Access databases to export data as .csv.

* I added load-groups and other requested features to an [energy-resilience simulation](https://github.com/bigladder/erin) library, used for catastrophic analysis of large-scale installations (e.g., military bases, universities).

* I presented a requested in-depth comparison of evaluation methods for a C++ [interpolation library](https://github.com/bigladder/btwxt) and generated documentation.

* I developed a [*boost* utility script](https://github.com/bigladder/kiva/blob/develop/scripts/update-boost.py) that swaps and minimizes boost versions.

***[Maptek](https://www.maptek.com/), Golden, Colorado***  
Software Engineer (Apr. 2022-Feb. 2023\)

* I provided maintenance on [Vulcan](https://www.maptek.com/products/vulcan/) software, fixing defects and creating unit tests, using a JIRA-based review system, with Mercurial for version control.

* In response to a user story, I added the ability to import large, [geo-tagged TIFF files](https://www.usgs.gov/global-fiducials-library-data-access-portal/data), by expanding the extant libTIFF driver and developing a novel [algorithm](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/Topo) to generate optimized, topographical triangulations with variable resolution.

***[Epilog](https://www.epiloglaser.com/), Golden, Colorado***  
Laser Alignment Technician (Oct. 2021-Apr. 2022\)

* I worked in a manufacturing environment to perform alignment of new and repaired CO2 lasers for laser cutting/engraving systems. 

***[South Dakota School of Mines](www.sdsmt.edu/), Rapid City, South Dakota***  
*Nanoscience & Nanoengineering Ph.D. Program*  
Professor (Aug 2017-Jul 2021\)

* My group worked on the optimization of ordered, metamorphic III-V films for red/amber LEDs. We demonstrated ordered/disordered epitaxial homostructures using a plasma-enhanced MOCVD [method](#pemocvd_paper). We measured the [strength of ordering](#precdiff_ord_paper) in these films by a precession-diffraction method, using automated alignment and acquistion. The patterns were refined to [dynamical simulations](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/PrecDiffFit). 

* Using [plasma-enhanced MOCVD](#PEMOCVD), we demonstrated epi-Al films on GaAs substrates and control of order/disorder in III-V alloy epilayers. 

* I contributed to a state-wide bio-imaging center supported through NSF. I advised graduate students on TEM analysis of mutated [cellular](#macrophage_paper) structures.

* I created additional special-topics [courses](https://spahrentech.com/notes/SelectedTopics/index.html) to meet graduate-research needs.

* I wrote a [Digital Micrograph](https://www.gatan.com/products/tem-analysis/digitalmicrograph-software) [script manager](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/DM_Scripts) and supporting plug-ins to improve the user experience and facilitate data archiving for the JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope, and to integrate automation of techniques (e.g., [montaging](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/DM_Scripts/blob/main/Scripts/Montage.s)).

* I served on several academic and campus committees, including University Research, Promotion & Tenure, Risk Management, Parking Appeals.

Associate Professor (Aug 2012-Jul 2017\)

* In a DOE partnership [support](#doe_partnership_2018), we developed PE-MOCVD to explore synthesis at far-from-equilibrium conditions. We synthesized high-mobility epi-GaAs [films](#flex_GaAs_paper) on flexible metal substrates, which were proposed for multijunction III-V devices. We confronted the central challenge of defect propagation in these materials with a broad range of innovative growth experiments. 

* We developed a focused-jet electrospinning [method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JB5l0zkqLs) for controlled synthesis of loaded polymeric nanofibers.

Assistant Professor (Aug 2006- Jul 2012\)

* I developed the core nanocharacterization graduate [course](#nano_703), and wrote a complete series of instructional experiments for that course to utilize instrumentation across campus. I taught all core courses for the program, and created elective courses on [crystallography](#nano_704), [nanomaterials](#nano_705), [photovoltaics](#nano_708), and [nanoelectronics](#nano_705). I also offered several selected topics [courses](#https://spahrentech.com/notes/SelectedTopics) in support of graduate research. I created an undergrade nanoscience [course](#nano_401).

* I managed the legacy Hitachi transmission electron microscope and trained users.  I added digital acquisition capability, and facilitated and coordinated access and training for student research throughout the state.

* I proposed the acquisition of the high-resolution JEOL TEM instrument, and oversaw the design, excavation, and renovation of specialized laboratory space for mechanical isolation of the instrument.

* I supported and advised student research through a university/DOE national laboratory [partnership](#doe_partnership_2007). We modified a home-built metalorganic chemical vapor deposition system to synthesize epitaxial films of III-V compound semiconductors engineered for multi-junction photovoltaics. For over a decade, the MOCVD system found numerous opportunities for student research and external collaboration, with extensive hardware and [software](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/MOCVD_Lib) customization.

* We developed a computational method to extract alloy [compositions](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927612013761) of alloy films from energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry. We also applied convergent-beam electron [diffraction](https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/CBED_fit) to metamorphic alloy films, to probe both composition and strain.

* Through a collaboration with [Vinča](https://www.vin.bg.ac.rs/en/) Institute, I investigated a broad range of metal and rare-earth oxide nanomaterials.

***[National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/), Golden, Colorado***  
*[National Center for Photovoltaics](https://www.nrel.gov/pv/research/national-center-for-photovoltaics)*  
Senior Scientist I (2001-2006)

* I identified the optimization criteria of compositional [grades](#grade_optimization_paper) used for metamorphic, semiconductor heterostructures with world-record photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic device efficiencies. Based on experimental investigations, I developed a detailed physical model of the relaxation behavior in the metamorphic grades that enable this technology.

* I designed and constructed a tunable light source to bias tandem solar cells during testing. 

* I studied the recrystallization phase-change kinetics of hydrogenated amorphous Si on glass substrates for low-cost photovoltaic applications.

* I supported the NREL Bioenergy Center by imaging carbon nanotubes and cellulose fibers used as templates for nanoparticle self-assembly.

* I used TEM [tomography](#nanotomo_paper) to elucidate the shapes and configurations of nanoparticles and ensembles. 

Scientist II (1998-2001)

* I worked closely with colloidal chemists to provide TEM characterization of semiconductor and metal nanoparticles. I supported aNREL projects involving a range of electronic materials, such as CuInSe<sub>2</sub>, Li:CoO<sub>2</sub>, VO<sub>x</sub>, BaSrTiO, and organic hybrids.

* I elucidated the dark-field imaging signatures of antiphase boundaries in ordered materials, and identified unique properties and physical origins of APBs in single-variant GaInAs.

Postdoctoral Scientist (1995–1998)

* I supported Basic Energy Sciences projects by using TEM to study ordered domain structures  and composition modulation in epitaxial III-V semiconductor alloys and short-period superlattices. We discovered a strong nanowire formation driven by lateral modulation in short-period [superlattices](#lateral_mod_AlInAs_paper).

* I generated theoretical models for TEM image contrast of partially ordered structures and modulated superlattices. I developed dynamical electron-diffraction software routines for experiment simulation and computational analysis of ordered structures. 

* I provided TEM analysis of a broad range single- and poly-crystalline thin-film materials, such as YBCO, ZnO, SiN, and Ge.

Graduate Research Assistant (1989–1991)

* I enrolled in the Physics Ph.D. program at CU, Boulder, an received GRA support at NREL, to study atomic ordering  phenomena in II-VI and III-V epitaxial semiconductor alloys. Spontaneous ordering has potentially useful influences on the optoelectronic properties of these materials. In collaboration with the University of Notre Dame, we discovered a novel form of [composition modulation](#comp_mod_ZST) in <nobr>ZnSe<sub>1-x</sub>Te<sub>x</sub></nobr> films that highlighted growth instabilities.

***[Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/), Golden, Colorado***  
*[Physics Department](https://physics.mines.edu/)*  
Graduate Research Assistant (1989–1991)

* I used X-ray diffraction to probe structural transitions during water intercalation in layered-silicate minerals. We applied similar methods to the copper-oxide superconductors, for which some forms also exhibit intercalation behavior.

* The software to run the four-circle X-ray diffractometer was limited when I started. I wrote a programmable XRD data acquisition/analysis software package.

***[CERN](https://home.cern/), Geneva, Switzerland***  
*NA36 Experiment*  
Summer Student  (June-Aug., 1987\)

* I assisted with installation of a time-projection chamber used in an SPS collider experiment.

* I procured and installed FASTBUS data-acquisition electronics, and wrote a test program.
