   abstract = {Hydration phase transitions in Na vermiculite, a specific example of expandable 2:1 layered silicates, were examined as a function of temperature at a constant water-vapor pressure by x-ray diffraction. The samples exhibited well-defined 0-, 1-, and 2-water-layer hydration states (WLHS’s) with the basal spacings of 9.81, 11.84, and 14.89 Å, respectively. The transitions between the hydration states were found to be first order, evidenced by a two-phase coexistence and large hysteresis. Substantial elastic deformation, which involves rotations of the tetragonal bases in the host silicate layers, was observed during the transitions. It was concluded that elastic distortion in the host layers may be responsible for the hydration phase transitions. In addition, formation of a (2a×2b) superlattice specific to the 1-WLHS was found. A new interpretation of the previous Raman data from 1-WLHS Na vermiculite is also presented.},

Transmission electron microscopy images of samples grown on four degree-tilted substrates showed superlattice-like structures, with periods in the range 13.4-28.9Â. Lattice images reveal diffuse interfaces between light and dark bands. Period variations were detected in isolated regions of some samples. We present evidence that the modulation develops at the growth surface, and remains stable in the bulk at temperatures up to 450°C. Satellite spot pairs with approximate indices (h k 1 + δ) were present near the zinc-blende spots in electron diffraction patterns and x-ray diffraction data, as expected from material with a sinusoidal composition profile. The orientation of the spots reveals that the modulation vector is parallel to the growth direction, rather than to [001] . The [111]A- and B-tilted samples showed significant modulation, while the five degree-[110] and on-axis material showed no detectable modulation. The modulation wavelength did not strongly depend on growth temperature in the range examined (285-335°C). Samples showing composition modulation did not exhibit significantly altered low-temperature luminescence spectra from material with no modulation. © 1995 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.},

   abstract = {<p>The application of III-V semiconductor alloys in device structures is of importance for high-speed microelectronics and optoelectronics. These alloys have allowed the device engineer to tailor material parameters such as the bandgap and carrier mobility to the need of the device by altering the alloy composition. When using ternary or quaternary materials, the device designer presumes that the alloy is completely disordered, without any correlation between the atoms on the cation (anion) sublattice. However the thermodynamics of the alloy system often produce material that has some degree of macroscopic or microscopic ordering. Short-range ordering occurs when atoms adopt correlated neighboring positions over distances of the order of a few lattice spacings. This can be manifested as the preferential association of like atoms, as in clustering, or of unlike atoms, as in chemical ordering (e.g., CuPt ordering). Long-range ordering occurs over many tens of lattice spacings, as in the case of phase separation. In either short-range or long-range ordering, the band structure and the crystal symmetry are greatly altered. Therefore it is absolutely critical that the mechanisms be fully understood to prevent ordering when necessary or to exploit it when possible.</p>},

In the quest for inexpensive substrates, thin-film Ge grown on glass is an attractive candidate if suitable grain growth can be achieved. Here we will describe Ge films that are deposited by an e-beam evaporator on glass and are approximately 2000 angstroms thick. The films were annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C to improve the quality of the material. The growth was done in three steps with 1000 angstroms of Ge, 70 angstroms of Sb, and followed by another 1000 angstroms of Ge. Sb is an n-type dopant in Ge and is included to enhance grain growth. The best films contained the Sb layer and hole concentrations between 1.4×10 15 to 1.6×10 17 cm -3 . The largest hole mobility measured was 30.6 cm 2 /Vs in the 1.4×10 15 p-type sample. The electron lifetime was measured by ultra-high frequency photoconductive decay and the best lifetimes were in the 30- to 40-ns range. Scanning-electron microscope and transmission-electron microscope studies indicated a polycrystalline grain structure with grain size comparable to the film thickness.},

   abstract = {<p>In the last ten years, the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has become capable of forming electron probes of atomic dimensions making possible a new approach to high-resolution electron microscopy, Z-contrast imaging. Formed by mapping the intensity of high-angle scattered electrons as the probe is scanned across the specimen, the Z-contrast image represents a direct map of the specimen scattering power at atomic resolution. It is an incoherent image, and can be directly interpreted in terms of atomic columns. High angle scattering comes predominantly from the atomic nuclei, so the scattering cross section depends on atomic number (Z) squared. Z-contrast microscopy can therefore be used to study compositional ordering and segregation at the atomic scale. Here we present three examples of ordering: first, ferroelectric materials, second, III-V semiconductor alloys, and finally, cooperative segregation at a semiconductor grain boundary, where a combination of Z-contrast imaging with first principles theory provides a complete atomic-scale view of the sites and configurations of the segregant atoms.</p>},

Single-variant ordered samples exhibit typical lifetimes of 30-60 μs, with no noticeable temperature dependence up to 300 K.

These results can be explained by electron delocalization in disordered close-packed solids; the spacing of electronic levels in the QDs is reduced and produces a redshift in the absorption spectra.</p>},

The model takes into account the size distribution of the two different laminae-shaped variants, the random distribution of antiphase domain boundaries in each variant, and the atomic displacements due to the bond-length difference between the two constitutive binary materials. A synchrotron x-ray source was employed to measure the weak-ordering reflections from CuPt-ordered Ga 0.5 In 0.5 P and Al 0.5 In 0.5 As samples. By comparing the experimental results and the model calculations, structure information, including the average number of atomic layers in the laminae of each variant, the average antiphase domain size, and the average order parameter in each variant, were obtained. Results from single-variant films and poorly ordered films are also discussed.},

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron diffraction, and Raman scattering data provide evidence for this structural polytype. Distinctive signatures of the CA polytype are found in the data from each of these methods, and their analyses are consistent with assignment of this crystallographic structure to the P4̄m2 space group.

The excess electrons that are produced in this reaction are most likely transferred to an oxide layer at the indium surface. For the synthesis of InP quantum rods with a narrow size distribution, a narrow size distribution of In(0) particles is also required because each indium droplet serves as a template to strictly limit the lateral growth of individual InP nanocrystals. Free-standing quantum rods, 60, 120, or 150 A in diameter, with aspect ratios of 1.6-3.5, and without the residual metallic catalyst at the rod tip, were synthesized from the diluted transparent solution of metallic indium particles. The same approach was used to synthesize InAs quantum rods. A photoactive InP-TiO(2) composite was also prepared by the same chemical procedure; InP nanocrystals grow as well-defined spherical or slightly elongated shapes on the TiO(2) surface.},

We have performed a characterization survey of 0.4-0.6-eV GaInAs/InAsP DHs using a variety of techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Dislocations are rarely observed to thread into the GaInAs active layers from the InAsP buffer layers that terminate the graded regions. Nearly complete strain relaxation occurs in buried regions of the InAsP grades. The buffer-layer strain prior to deposition of the active layer is virtually independent of the net misfit. Foreknowledge of this buffer-layer strain is essential to correctly lattice match the buffer to the GaInAs active layer.},

The synthetic protocol described here avoids the need for covalent chemical modification of carbon nanotube (CNT) surfaces. Specifically, InP quantum dots (QDs) and CdSe QDs were found to strongly adsorb onto the surfaces of carbon single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) by gentle heating in organic solvents. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the semiconductor nanocrystal (NC) / SWNT assemblies, and revealed that the surfaces of the SWNT bundles template the adsorption of the NCs from solution. Small QDs were found to randomly absorb onto SWNTs, while larger QDs self-assembled into long linear chains. The nature of binding and ordering was investigated by simply considering van der Waals (vdW) forces for both NC-SWNT and NC-NC interactions. Quantum rods (QRs) were also found to adsorb along the nanotube surfaces. These findings have important implications for the synthesis of NC / SWNT hybrid nanostructures.</p>},

However, other sources of XRD line broadening exist in such materials in addition to crystallite size, including the density of crystallite defects. To address these issues, TEM measurements have also been performed on a-Si:H films deposited directly onto TEM grids. Following the procedure of Iverson and Reif (J. Appl. Phys. 62 (1987) 1675), an examination of films with low grain density enables a determination of the crystallite nucleation rate as well as grain growth rate. We compare the results for HWCVD films of different film C H , and also for HWCVD and PECVD a-Si:H films containing the same initial film C H . We also perform Raman measurements on fully crystallized HWCVD films to explore whether film disorder plays a role in the different XRD FWHMs when different amounts of film hydrogen are evolved. © 2006 IEEE.},

At high temperature (825°C) and long time (30 h), microstructural differences were significant for the powders treated with different salts. Particle morphologies ranged from equiaxed, to acicular, to bundles, to nanofibers with very high aspect ratio. At lower treatment temperature (725°C) for shorter time (3 h), the morphology of the products did not change with different salt compositions, but the crystallite sizes changed appreciably. Different starting titanium precursors influenced particle size at lower temperature and time.

   abstract = {<p>Utilizing the concepts of a critical crystallite size and local film inhomogeneity, it is shown that nucleation in thermally annealed hydrogenated amorphous silicon occurs in the more well ordered spatial regions in the network, which are defined by the initial inhomogeneous H distributions in the as‐grown films. Although the film H evolves very early during annealing, the local film order is largely retained in the still amorphous films even after the vast majority of the H is evolved, and the more well ordered regions which are the nucleation center sites for crystallization are those spatial regions which do not initially contain clustered H, as probed by H NMR spectroscopy. The sizes of these better ordered regions relative to a critical crystallite size determine the film incubation times (the time before the onset of crystallization). Changes in film short range order upon H evolution, and the presence of microvoid type structures in the as grown films play no role in the crystallization process. While the creation of dangling bonds upon H evolution may play a role in the actual phase transformation itself, the film defect densities measured just prior to the onset of crystallization exhibit no trends which can be correlated with the film incubation times.</p>},

   abstract = {InGaAs strain relaxation is studied by an in situ multibeam optical stress sensor (MOSS). Strain relaxation during growth of InGaAs on GaAs occurs at different thicknesses and rates along the directions perpendicular to its misfit dislocations, [110] and [1 1 0] . We show the asymmetry of relaxation between these directions in real time by aligning the MOSS laser array along [110] and [1 1 0] . This asymmetric relaxation data from the MOSS correlates with both x-ray diffraction relaxation analysis and an estimation of the misfit dislocation density from transmission electron microscopy images. Lowering the V/III ratio or raising the growth temperature lowers the thickness of the onset of dislocation formation, changes the relaxation rate, lowers the final relaxation during 2 μm of growth, and shifts the initial direction of relaxation from [110] to [1 1 0] . We identify two phases of relaxation that occur at different growth thicknesses. Lowering the V/III ratio changes the relative contribution of each of these phases to the total relaxation of the epilayer. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Solid-phase crystallization kinetics are examined during thermal annealing of as-deposited hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films deposited by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The influence of deposition temperature of HWCVD material on crystallization is also considered. Real-time observation of the crystallization process using in situ transmission electron microscope heating allowed tracking of the crystalline volume fraction and grain number density by image-processing methods. Beyond an initial incubation period, roughly constant grain nucleation rate and growth velocity are observed. Extrapolation from early stages of crystallization allows estimation of the final average grain sizes. PECVD material shows a much lower nucleation rate than does HWCVD material under the same annealing conditions, whereas the grain growth velocities are comparable, leading to dramatically larger grain sizes in PECVD material. X-ray diffraction line widths from PECVD material are broader compared to HWCVD material. The diffraction line broadening is primarily determined by intragranular defect structure, rather than grain size. Lowerature preannealing reduced the final XRD line widths of HWCVD material, indicating an influence on defect structure or density. Lattice contraction during crystallization of HWCVD material is observed to be independent of the initial hydrogen content. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The photocatalytic activity of TiO <sub>2</sub> /Ag nanofibers was compared to the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO <sub>2</sub> nanofibers by studying the photodegradation of methyl red dye under UV light irradiation, in a photoreactor. UV‐visible absorbance spectra showed that the rate of decay of the dye in case of photodegradation by TiO <sub>2</sub> /Ag nanofibers was 10.3 times higher than that by pure TiO <sub>2</sub> nanofibers. The retaining of the fiber morphology along with the increased surface area due to the addition of Ag nanoparticles can be believed to enhance the photocatalytic oxidation of methyl red dye. </p>},

The as-synthesised Sb 2 S 3 nanobars with various precursor concentrations and heating times showed differences in the morphology (open and enclosing forms) and structural parameters. UV-vis absorption measurements revealed that the optical band gap energies lay in the red part of the solar spectrum. The observed band gap energies, of nearly the same values (∼1.6 eV), proved that precursor concentrations and heating times had no effect on them. The structure refinement showed that the Sb 2 S 3 powder belonged to the orthorhombic type with a space group Pbnm. It was found that Sb 2 S 3 nanobars predominantly grew along the [010] direction, and that the unit cell parameters and the preferred orientation parameter (τ) refined against experimental data were quite dependent on both the precursor concentration and the heating time. The optimum heating time to nicely follow the dependence of structural parameters on the precursor concentration was observed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {<p>Given an unknown multicomponent alloy, and a set of standard compounds or alloys of known composition, can one improve upon popular standards-based methods for energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry to quantify the elemental composition of the unknown specimen? A method is presented here for determining elemental composition of alloys using transmission electron microscopy–based EDX with appropriate standards. The method begins with a discrete set of related reference standards of known composition, applies multivariate statistical analysis to those spectra, and evaluates the compositions with a linear matrix algebra method to relate the spectra to elemental composition. By using associated standards, only limited assumptions about the physical origins of the EDX spectra are needed. Spectral absorption corrections can be performed by providing an estimate of the foil thickness of one or more reference standards. The technique was applied to III-V multicomponent alloy thin films: composition and foil thickness were determined for various III-V alloys. The results were then validated by comparing with X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence analysis, demonstrating accuracy of approximately 1% in atomic fraction.</p>},

The physicochemical properties of the composite materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements confirmed the presence of Pt species existing as PtO 2 and/or mixtures of Pt 0 and PtO 2 . The composite material, Pt-TiO 2 -2%H, contained a high amount of metallic Pt 0 and PtO 2 in close proximity with TiO 2 that promoted an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under simulated solar light irradiation. Although Pt-TiO 2 -2%C and Pt-TiO 2 -2%T consisted of similar compositions of PtO 2 , these oxidized platinum species seem to appear further apart from TiO 2 in Pt-TiO 2 -2%C than Pt-TiO 2 -2%T. This caused dramatic variation in their optical behaviors such as strong fluorescence quenching and lower photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in the former photocatalyst. A photocatalyst prepared by the conventional photodeposition method was also prepared, characterized, and its photocatalytic activity assessed. This work provides an opportunity to understand the role of PtO 2 for photocatalytic production of hydrogen from platinized TiO 2 composites and the importance of heterojunctions in such photocatalysts for solar energy conversion. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

In this report, a cost- and time-effective method for synthesis of Y 2 O 3 :Yb 3+ , Er 3+ nanoparticles that exhibit up-conversion emission under infrared excitation is presented. The synthesis method is based on the self-propagating, room-temperature reaction between metal nitrates and sodium hydroxide, and a subsequent calcination process. Series of samples were prepared with calcinations at various temperatures (600 °C, 800 °C and 1100 °C) for 1 h, and also with different Yb 3+ -Er 3+ ratios (10:1, 5:1 and 2:1). All calcined samples crystallized in a cubic bixbyite crystal phase with crystallite size from 12 to 44 nm in diameter, for samples calcined at 600 °C and 1100 °C, respectively. Different nanoparticle morphologies were obtained after calcinations on different temperatures; at temperatures under 1100 °C rod-like particles were obtained, while at 1100 °C spherical particles were formed. In all samples up-conversion emissions and corresponding lifetimes were measured after excitation in room temperature at 978 nm. The most intense emission originates from the characteristic intra-shell f-f electronic transitions of Er 3+ ions: [ 2 H 9/2 → 4 I 15/2 ] in blue (407-420 nm); [( 2 H 11/2 , 4 S 3/2 )→ 4 I 15/2 ] green: 510-590 nm; and [ 4 F 9/2 → 4 I 15/2 ] in red (640-720 nm) spectral regions.},

   abstract = {© 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd. The performance of Sm 3+  doped TiO2 nanoparticles for luminescence temperature sensing was tested over a temperature range from room to 110 °C. The Sm 3+  ions were incorporated into TiO2 nanocrystals using hydrolytic sol-gel route. Microstructural characterization of the obtained material was performed using transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Luminescence emission spectra of Sm 3+  doped TiO2 nanoparticles consists of two distinct spectral regions: the high energy region associated with the trap emission of the TiO2 host, and the low energy region with well-resolved emission peaks of the Sm 3+  ions. The ratio between Sm 3+  emission and TiO2 trap emission shows strong temperature dependence, and is tested for temperature sensing. The relative sensor sensitivity was found to be higher than 1% °C -1  over given temperature range with the maximum value of 10.54% °C -1  at 57.5 °C. Lifetime data derived from the Sm 3+  emission decay revealed that time-resolved measurements provide comparable quality of temperature sensing as corresponding ratiometric measurements, with a maximum relative sensitivity of 10.14% °C -1  at 66.5 °C.},

   abstract = {© 2015, The Minerals, Metals  &  Materials Society and ASM International. We report the synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-leaves and nano-rods under high and extremely high alkaline experimental conditions, via a simple and low-temperature method. By performing transmission electron microscopy it is found that the nano-leaves and nano-rods grow along the (001) direction. Anisotropic, i.e., hkl-dependent line-shape broadening is observed in ZnO powder diffraction patterns. Rietveld analysis using Fullprof with model for handling the anisotropic size-like broadening is performed on these diffraction patterns. The refinement showed that ZnO powders belong to the hexagonal ZnS structure type with space group P63mc, and confirmed that the nano-leaves and nano-rods are oriented along the (001) direction. Results of visualization in 3D of the average crystallite shape obtained from refinement of spherical harmonics coefficients showed elongated shapes in the both samples, exhibiting a slight twisting for nano-leaves. Diffuse reflectance measurements reveal that the optical band-gap energies found for the ZnO nano-leaves and nano-rods is somewhat smaller than a wide-direct band gap of 3.37 eV. We argued that well defined and strong photoluminescence (PL) bands in the visible part that belong to the defects may influence the observed displacement of a ultraviolet (UV) near-band-edge emission, and which is related with obtained slightly lower band-gap energies than the established band gap of bulk ZnO. We discuss processes behind the multicolor UV/violet/blue/green/yellow emission band in PL spectra.},

Gold-polyaniline (Au-PANI) nanocomposite was prepared using a simple interfacial polymerization method, performed in an immiscible water/toluene biphasic system using tetrachloroaurate, AuCl 4 -  as an oxidant. The formation of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) or Au-PANI nanocomposite can be controlled to a certain degree by varying the ratio of initial Au +  and aniline concentrations. Under optimal condition (HAuCl 4 /aniline ratio is 1:2), green dispersion of Au-PANI nanocomposite is produced in aqueous phase, whose morphology,structure and physicochemical properties are investigated in details. The nanocomposite shows granular morphology with mostly rodlike AuNPs embedded in polymer. It was found that polyaniline in the composite is in the conducting emeraldine salt form, containing high amount of  Au (28.85 wt %). Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite was found to be four-fold higher than that of the polymer itself. In addition, the nanocomposite powder, isolated from the as-prepared aqueous dispersion, can later be easily redispersed in water and further used for various applications. Moreover, the obtained Au-PANI nanocomposite showed excellent electrocatalytic performance toward the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with high ORR onset potential and good selectivity. This makes it a promising candidate for a new class of Pt-free ORR catalyst.},

The thorough study of Eu-concentration influence on particle's structure, morphology and luminescence is presented. This type of synthesis provides particles of ∼5 nm in diameter, which crystallize in a defect fluorite structure (space group Fm-3m), and where each particle consists of a single crystallite, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. With the increase of Eu concentration, the unit-cell parameter slightly increases to accommodate larger Eu 3+ ions at sites of smaller Y 3+ , while the shape and size of particles remain the same. Analysis of emission intensity and decay dependence on Eu concentration showed that this host material could be heavily doped with Eu since concentration quenching of emission occurs at high Eu content of 25–30 at.% (with respect to Y ions). The critical distance for energy transfer between Eu ions is estimated to 10.28 Å and dipole–quadrupole interaction is found as the dominant mechanism responsible for the concentration quenching of emission. Radiative and non-radiative transition rates, the quantum efficiency of emission, Ω-intensity parameters, and branching ratios of Eu 3+ emission are calculated for nanocrystals of all doping concentrations. It is found that more “to-the-point” expression 86% of emission comes from 5 D 0 → 7 F 2 and 5 D 0 → 7 F 1 transitions. Therefore, this phosphor emits pure red light with (0.661, 0.338) CIE color coordinates.},

The synthesized rod-like Ag 2 CO 3 particles (2–4 × 0.3–0.6 μm, length × diameter) served as a precursor for preparation of the AgX/Ag 2 CO 3 (X = Cl, I) composites by ion exchange method. The various microstructural (X-ray diffraction analysis, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms) and optical (diffuse reflection spectroscopy) techniques were used for thorough characterization of obtained heterostructures. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of AgX/Ag 2 CO 3 heterostructures in comparison to Ag 2 CO 3 nanorods (NRs) was evidenced using degradation of organic dye methylene blue as a test reaction. Also, the formation of composites improved their stability under long run illumination conditions. The effect of AgX content on photocatalytic activity of the composites were also investigated. The possible photocatalytic mechanism that facilitates efficient separation of photo-formed charge carriers in heterostructures was discussed in terms of the relative energetic of valence and conduction bands.},

Nanosized ZnIn 2 S 4 is successfully synthesized in oleic acid/oleylamine mixture in different ratios, which are both: complexing and/or capping agents. Nanosheets/nanoscrolls of about 50 nm are obtained. The band gaps of synthesized nanostructures were calculated to be in the range from 2.6 to 3.0 eV, values which are increased compared to bulk value (2.3–2.5 eV). The increase of band gap can be assigned to nanodimensions of the particles. Potential of band edges is calculated using empirical equation and find to be in the range from −0.16 to −0.36 V for conduction band, and from 2.24 to 2.69 V for valence band. By using XRD and TEM techniques, crystal structure and morphology of obtained materials were investigated, and detailed formation and growth mechanism of nanosheets/nanoscroles is proposed accordingly.},

The coordination of 5-ASA to the surface of BHAP leads to the charge transfer (CT) complex formation accompanied with absorption in visible spectral range. The sorption ability of surface-modified BHAP with 5-ASA (5-ASA/BHAP) for removal of Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ ions from single- and bi-component solutions was compared with unmodified BHAP. The thorough characterization of both sorbents, BHAP and 5-ASA/BHAP, was performed including X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as well as diffuse reflection spectroscopy. Sorption kinetics and equilibriums for both ions (Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ ) by as-prepared BHAP and 5-ASA/BHAP are quite different. Functionalized sorbent demonstrated faster sorption kinetic and higher maximum sorption capacity for Pb 2+ ions from bi-component solutions. From equimolar Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ mixture with a total concentration of 10 -2 mol/L, 66% of Pb 2+ was recovered using BHAP, while 97% using 5-ASA/BHAP. These preliminary data indicate potential applicability of properly functionalized hydroxyapatite for selective removal of heavy metal ions from contaminated water.},

The antigenotoxic and antioxidative properties of surface-modified TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) with ascorbic acid (AA) were compared with those of constituents (free AA and bare TiO 2 NPs). Colloids consisting of the TiO 2 NPs with anatase crystal structure were prepared by acidic hydrolysis of TiCl 4 . The synthesized TiO 2 NPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The charge transfer (CT) complex formation between surface Ti atoms and AA is indicated by immediate appearance of red color. Composition and stability constants of CT complex were determined using Job's method and Banesi-Hildebrand analysis, respectively. The surface structure of CT complex was determined from infra-red spectra of free and bound AA to the surface Ti atoms. The experimental data were supported with quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The antigenotoxic potential of CT complex was evaluated in leukocytes of whole blood cells in vitro by comet assay method. For evaluation of antioxidant properties, total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were determined in human serum pool in vitro. The presented results indicate that bare TiO 2 NPs have more pronounced antigenotoxic effects in comparison with either surface-modified TiO 2 NPs with AA or free AA. No significant differences between the antigenotoxic and antioxidative properties of free and bound AA on the TiO 2 NPs were noticed in the investigated concentration range. It seems that surface-modified TiO 2 NPs with AA and/or similar compounds can be used to maintain its beneficial activities.},

   abstract = {Thin film fabrication is necessary to realize the device integration of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and solution-based crystallization methods have been employed widely to this end. Despite the versatility of the solution approach, device fabrication using typical "top-down" lithography is generally incompatible with as-prepared OIHPs films because of the low stability of perovskites to polar solvents involved in the lithographic process. Moreover, solution-prepared perovskites usually exhibit irregular surface roughness, implying the existence of randomly oriented crystal domains with a large density of grain boundaries, which are ultimately detrimental to the material properties. Here, we report a patterning of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films using a photolithographically fabricated cross-linked copolymer template on Si or SiO2 substrates via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Perovskite patterning is accomplished by growing PbI2 precursor layers selectively on template patterns and subsequently converting to MAPbI3 using CH3NH3I (MAI) in the vapor phase. We confirm that [0001]-oriented PbI2 nanoplatelets nucleate primarily on a Si or SiO2 surface and grow by surface diffusion from a polymer surface. The MAPbI3 conversion process preserves the original pattern morphology through the vapor-solid intercalation of MAI. Prototype photodetector arrays based on MAPbI3 patterns are also demonstrated. Our results highlight the advantages of the CVD patterning of perovskite materials in large-scale production for a range of optoelectronic applications.},

   abstract = {Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society. Interfacial charge transfer (ICT) complexes between wide-band-gap metal oxides and small colorless organic molecules have promising use in a variety of applications. The possibility to control optical properties and alignment of energy levels by a proper combination of inorganic and organic parts of ICT complexes is the main advantage of such materials. We used vacuum-ultraviolet electron imaging photoelectron spectroscopy (VUV PES) to determine the ionization potentials of isolated TiO2 nanoparticles surface-modified with salicylic acid (SA) and 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). The VUV PES measurements indicated a shift of the photoemission onset from 7.2 eV, observed for pristine TiO2 nanoparticles, to 6.5 and 5.9 eV for the surface-modified ones, with SA and 5-ASA, respectively. These results are consistent with the red shift of the absorption onset observed upon surface modification of TiO2 colloids. To obtain a detailed description of the optical properties of surface-modified TiO2 with SA and 5-ASA, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and with a finite-size TiO2 cluster. The PBC model provides a qualitatively good description of electronic states of oxide surfaces functionalized with small organic molecules, while an excellent agreement between experimentally determined and calculated band gap values using a finite-size model was found.},

   abstract = {The effect of dextran-coated silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs 12.0 ± 1.9 nm) loading (0−0.42 wt%) on the mechanical, barrier, and antimicrobial properties of thin (50−60 μm) films prepared from cellulose nanofibrils by solvent casting method were studied as eco-friendly and food-preservative packaging materials. The presence of dextran was shown to act not only as a dispersing media for Ag NPs and controlling its release but also as a moisture-resistant sealable additive that, synergetically with reduced oxygen permeability, may preserve the food against bacteria growth. Thus, significantly reduced Oxygen Transmission Rates (from 2.07 to 1.40-0.78 cm3 m−2d−1) and hydrophilicity (from 20.8° to 52.4° for MilliQ water, and from 35-37° to 62-74° for 3 % acetic acid and 0.9 % NaCl simulant solutions), yielding a 99.9 % inhibition of Escherichia coli after five repeated cycles of 24 h exposure to 0.9 % NaCl solution was displayed, supported by a controlled release of Ag+ ions (below the toxicologically harmful threshold, <0.5 mg L-1).},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. The aim of this study was the development of a non-toxic, biosynthetic antimicrobial agent which selectively acts on only one type of microorganism, and preserves the microbiota. Antimicrobial performance of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) by horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.) extract was examined against Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, as well as yeasts Candida albicans and Saccharomyces boulardii. Also, the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs was examined toward pre-osteoblast cells. The synthetic conditions—concentration of extract, temperature, and pH—were optimized to prepare silver colloids with different particle size distributions and long-term stability. The obtained samples were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and absorption spectroscopy. The smaller-sized Ag NPs (~ 10–20 nm), prepared at a lower temperature (20 °C), showed better antimicrobial performance against E. coli compared to larger ones (~ 40–60 nm), prepared at high temperature (100 °C). On the other hand, both samples did not display any toxic action against bacteria S. aureus, or yeasts C. albicans and S. boulardii. Non-cytotoxic behavior of Ag NPs toward pre-osteoblast cells was observed for the concentrations of silver ≤ 2.25 and ≤ 4.5 mg L−1 for 10–20 and 40–60 nm-sized Ag NPs, respectively. Biosynthesized Ag NPs by horsetail extract display selective toxic action against E. coli at the ecologically acceptable concentration level.},

   abstract = {<p> Precession electron diffraction (PED) was used to measure the long‐range order parameter in lattice‐mismatched AlInP epitaxial films under investigation for solid‐state‐lighting applications. Both double‐ and single‐variant films grown at 620, 650 and 680 °C were analysed in TEM cross‐section. PED patterns were acquired in selected‐area‐diffraction mode through external microscope control using serial acquisition, which allows inline image processing. The integrated peak intensities from experimental patterns were fit using dynamical simulations of diffraction from the ordered domain structures. Included in the structure‐factor calculations were mean atomic displacements of the anions (P) due to ordering, which were found by valence‐force‐field calculations to have a nearly linear dependence on order parameter. A maximum order parameter of <italic>S</italic> = 0.36 was measured for a double‐variant specimen grown at 650 °C. </p>},
