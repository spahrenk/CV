   abstract = {<p>GaSb grown on GaAs through interfacial misfit (IMF) arrays grown via molecular beam epitaxy has been heavily studied; there is limited research, however, on IMF growth through metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. To demonstrate viability for integration in a multijunction solar cell for terrestrial use, it is imperative to demonstrate high quality GaSb grown on GaAs through metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. The preferred gallium precursors for n-type and p-type GaSb for longest minority carrier diffusion length were determined to be trimethylgallium and triethylgallium, respectively. A heteroepitaxial GaSb-on-GaAs device attained an open-circuit voltage of 190 mV and an efficiency of 2.2%. Extracted threading dislocation density from the minority carrier lifetime for the heteroepitaxial GaSb-on-GaAs device was determined to be 7.5×106cm−2. In a modeled multijunction solar cell, this device attributes to an overall efficiency of 33.1% under AM1.5g illumination.</p>},

Thus, significantly reduced Oxygen Transmission Rates (from 2.07 to 1.40-0.78 cm3 m−2d−1) and hydrophilicity (from 20.8° to 52.4° for MilliQ water, and from 35-37° to 62-74° for 3 % acetic acid and 0.9 % NaCl simulant solutions), yielding a 99.9 % inhibition of Escherichia coli after five repeated cycles of 24 h exposure to 0.9 % NaCl solution was displayed, supported by a controlled release of Ag+ ions (below the toxicologically harmful threshold, <0.5 mg L-1).},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. The aim of this study was the development of a non-toxic, biosynthetic antimicrobial agent which selectively acts on only one type of microorganism, and preserves the microbiota. Antimicrobial performance of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) by horsetail (Equisetum arvense L.) extract was examined against Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, as well as yeasts Candida albicans and Saccharomyces boulardii. Also, the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs was examined toward pre-osteoblast cells. The synthetic conditions—concentration of extract, temperature, and pH—were optimized to prepare silver colloids with different particle size distributions and long-term stability. The obtained samples were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and absorption spectroscopy. The smaller-sized Ag NPs (~ 10–20 nm), prepared at a lower temperature (20 °C), showed better antimicrobial performance against E. coli compared to larger ones (~ 40–60 nm), prepared at high temperature (100 °C). On the other hand, both samples did not display any toxic action against bacteria S. aureus, or yeasts C. albicans and S. boulardii. Non-cytotoxic behavior of Ag NPs toward pre-osteoblast cells was observed for the concentrations of silver ≤ 2.25 and ≤ 4.5 mg L−1 for 10–20 and 40–60 nm-sized Ag NPs, respectively. Biosynthesized Ag NPs by horsetail extract display selective toxic action against E. coli at the ecologically acceptable concentration level.},

About 40%‐50% of patients have kidney abnormalities, and frequently display multicystic, dysplastic kidneys. Additionally, gain‐of‐function mutations in <italic>NOTCH2</italic> are associated with cystic kidneys in Hajdu‐Cheney syndrome patients. How perturbations in Notch signaling cause renal tubular cysts remains unclear. Here, we have determined that reduced Notch signaling mediated transcription by ectopic expression of dominant‐negative mastermind‐like (dnMaml) peptide in the nephrogenic epithelia from after the s‐shaped body formation and in the developing collecting ducts results in proximal tubular and collecting duct cysts, respectively. An acute inhibition of Notch signaling for two days during kidney development is sufficient to disrupt tubule formation, and significantly increases <italic>Akap12</italic> expression. Ectopic expression of Akap12 in renal epithelia results in abnormally long primary cilia similar to that observed in Notch‐signaling‐deficient epithelia. Both loss of Notch signaling and elevated Akap12 expression disrupt the ability of renal epithelial cells to form spherical structures with a single lumen when grown embedded in matrix. Interestingly, Akap12 can inhibit Notch signaling mediated transcription, which likely explains how both loss of Notch signaling and ectopic expression of Akap12 result in similar renal epithelial abnormalities. We conclude that Notch signaling regulates <italic>Akap12</italic> expression while also ensuring normal primary cilia length and renal epithelial morphogenesis, and suggest that one aspect of diseases associated with defective Notch signaling, such as Alagille syndrome, maybe mechanistically related to ciliopathies. </p>},

Surface modification of Al2O3powders, prepared using reproducible sol-gel synthetic route with small colorless organic molecules, induces charge transfer complex formation and the appearance of absorption in the visible spectral region. Comprehensive microstructural characterization involving transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, revealed that γ-crystalline alumina powders consist of mesoporous particles in the size range from 0.1 to 0.3 μm, with specific surface area of 54.8 m2/g, and pore radius between 3 and 4 nm. The attachment of catecholate-type of ligands (catechol, caffeic acid, gallic acid, dopamine and 2,3-dihydroxy naphthalene), salicylate-type of ligands (salicylic acid and 5-amino salicylic acid), and ascorbic acid, to the surface such γ-Al2O3particles leads to the formation of colored powders and activates their absorption in visible-light spectral region. To the best of our knowledge, similar transformation of an insulator (Al2O3), with the band gap energy of 8.7 eV, into a semiconductor-like hybrid material with tunable optical properties has not been reported in the literature before. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations with periodic boundary conditions were performed in order to estimate the energy gaps of various inorganic/organic hybrids. The calculated values compare well with the experimental data. The good agreement between the calculated and experimentally determined band gaps was found, thus demonstrating predictive ability of the theory when proper model is used.},

   abstract = {Thin film fabrication is necessary to realize the device integration of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and solution-based crystallization methods have been employed widely to this end. Despite the versatility of the solution approach, device fabrication using typical "top-down" lithography is generally incompatible with as-prepared OIHPs films because of the low stability of perovskites to polar solvents involved in the lithographic process. Moreover, solution-prepared perovskites usually exhibit irregular surface roughness, implying the existence of randomly oriented crystal domains with a large density of grain boundaries, which are ultimately detrimental to the material properties. Here, we report a patterning of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin films using a photolithographically fabricated cross-linked copolymer template on Si or SiO2 substrates via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Perovskite patterning is accomplished by growing PbI2 precursor layers selectively on template patterns and subsequently converting to MAPbI3 using CH3NH3I (MAI) in the vapor phase. We confirm that [0001]-oriented PbI2 nanoplatelets nucleate primarily on a Si or SiO2 surface and grow by surface diffusion from a polymer surface. The MAPbI3 conversion process preserves the original pattern morphology through the vapor-solid intercalation of MAI. Prototype photodetector arrays based on MAPbI3 patterns are also demonstrated. Our results highlight the advantages of the CVD patterning of perovskite materials in large-scale production for a range of optoelectronic applications.},

Optical, structural and morphological characteristics of the formed nanocomposites were identified. It was found that AuNRs are embedded in the conducting emeraldine salt form of PANI. Nanocomposites containing 2.0 and 28.9 wt% of Au were subsequently systematically studied for borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) for potential application in direct borohydride-peroxide fuel cell (DBPFC). Reaction parameters: number of electrons exchanged, order of reaction and activation energy, were evaluated. Both Au-PANI nanocomposites showed activity for BOR. A laboratory DBPFC was tested reaching specific peak power density of 184 Wg-1 at 65 °C with Au-PANI 1 nanocomposite (containing only 2.0 wt% of Au) as anode.},

   abstract = {Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society. Interfacial charge transfer (ICT) complexes between wide-band-gap metal oxides and small colorless organic molecules have promising use in a variety of applications. The possibility to control optical properties and alignment of energy levels by a proper combination of inorganic and organic parts of ICT complexes is the main advantage of such materials. We used vacuum-ultraviolet electron imaging photoelectron spectroscopy (VUV PES) to determine the ionization potentials of isolated TiO2 nanoparticles surface-modified with salicylic acid (SA) and 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). The VUV PES measurements indicated a shift of the photoemission onset from 7.2 eV, observed for pristine TiO2 nanoparticles, to 6.5 and 5.9 eV for the surface-modified ones, with SA and 5-ASA, respectively. These results are consistent with the red shift of the absorption onset observed upon surface modification of TiO2 colloids. To obtain a detailed description of the optical properties of surface-modified TiO2 with SA and 5-ASA, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and with a finite-size TiO2 cluster. The PBC model provides a qualitatively good description of electronic states of oxide surfaces functionalized with small organic molecules, while an excellent agreement between experimentally determined and calculated band gap values using a finite-size model was found.},

Syntheses were performed at initial ZrO 2 /aniline mole ratios 50, 100 and 150 to produce ZP-50, ZP-100 and ZP-150. The morphological, structural, and optical properties of the synthesized nanocomposites were studied using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman, UV-Vis and Electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. EPR spectra of ZP-50 and ZP-100 nanocomposites showed the presence of intensive peak at the g-values comparable to that for free electrons (2.0023) indicating the presence of oligo/poly (semiquinone radical cations), i.e. polarons as charge carriers in PANI part; ZP-150 showed weak polaron peak of PANI, and peak that can be assigned to defects in zirconia matrix (Zr 3+ , oxygen vacancies). The monoclinic crystal structure of ZrO 2 nanoparticles in all nanocomposites was confirmed by XRD and by Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities of ZP nanocomposites were evaluated using the photocatalytic degradation of trichlorophenol (TCP) and Rhodamine B model compounds and compared with the activity of bare ZrO 2 nanoparticles. Enhanced degradation efficiencies of nanocomposites regarding TCP degradation were observed.},

The thorough study of Eu-concentration influence on particle's structure, morphology and luminescence is presented. This type of synthesis provides particles of ∼5 nm in diameter, which crystallize in a defect fluorite structure (space group Fm-3m), and where each particle consists of a single crystallite, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. With the increase of Eu concentration, the unit-cell parameter slightly increases to accommodate larger Eu 3+ ions at sites of smaller Y 3+ , while the shape and size of particles remain the same. Analysis of emission intensity and decay dependence on Eu concentration showed that this host material could be heavily doped with Eu since concentration quenching of emission occurs at high Eu content of 25–30 at.% (with respect to Y ions). The critical distance for energy transfer between Eu ions is estimated to 10.28 Å and dipole–quadrupole interaction is found as the dominant mechanism responsible for the concentration quenching of emission. Radiative and non-radiative transition rates, the quantum efficiency of emission, Ω-intensity parameters, and branching ratios of Eu 3+ emission are calculated for nanocrystals of all doping concentrations. It is found that more “to-the-point” expression 86% of emission comes from 5 D 0 → 7 F 2 and 5 D 0 → 7 F 1 transitions. Therefore, this phosphor emits pure red light with (0.661, 0.338) CIE color coordinates.},

The thorough characterization of both sorbents, BHAP and 5-ASA/BHAP, was performed including X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, as well as diffuse reflection spectroscopy. Sorption kinetics and equilibriums for both ions (Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ ) by as-prepared BHAP and 5-ASA/BHAP are quite different. Functionalized sorbent demonstrated faster sorption kinetic and higher maximum sorption capacity for Pb 2+ ions from bi-component solutions. From equimolar Pb 2+ and Cu 2+ mixture with a total concentration of 10 -2 mol/L, 66% of Pb 2+ was recovered using BHAP, while 97% using 5-ASA/BHAP. These preliminary data indicate potential applicability of properly functionalized hydroxyapatite for selective removal of heavy metal ions from contaminated water.},

   abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier B.V. The antigenotoxic and antioxidative properties of surface-modified TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) with ascorbic acid (AA) were compared with those of constituents (free AA and bare TiO 2 NPs). Colloids consisting of the TiO 2 NPs with anatase crystal structure were prepared by acidic hydrolysis of TiCl 4 . The synthesized TiO 2 NPs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The charge transfer (CT) complex formation between surface Ti atoms and AA is indicated by immediate appearance of red color. Composition and stability constants of CT complex were determined using Job's method and Banesi-Hildebrand analysis, respectively. The surface structure of CT complex was determined from infra-red spectra of free and bound AA to the surface Ti atoms. The experimental data were supported with quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The antigenotoxic potential of CT complex was evaluated in leukocytes of whole blood cells in vitro by comet assay method. For evaluation of antioxidant properties, total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were determined in human serum pool in vitro. The presented results indicate that bare TiO 2 NPs have more pronounced antigenotoxic effects in comparison with either surface-modified TiO 2 NPs with AA or free AA. No significant differences between the antigenotoxic and antioxidative properties of free and bound AA on the TiO 2 NPs were noticed in the investigated concentration range. It seems that surface-modified TiO 2 NPs with AA and/or similar compounds can be used to maintain its beneficial activities.},

   abstract = {© 2015, The Minerals, Metals  &  Materials Society and ASM International. We report the synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-leaves and nano-rods under high and extremely high alkaline experimental conditions, via a simple and low-temperature method. By performing transmission electron microscopy it is found that the nano-leaves and nano-rods grow along the (001) direction. Anisotropic, i.e., hkl-dependent line-shape broadening is observed in ZnO powder diffraction patterns. Rietveld analysis using Fullprof with model for handling the anisotropic size-like broadening is performed on these diffraction patterns. The refinement showed that ZnO powders belong to the hexagonal ZnS structure type with space group P63mc, and confirmed that the nano-leaves and nano-rods are oriented along the (001) direction. Results of visualization in 3D of the average crystallite shape obtained from refinement of spherical harmonics coefficients showed elongated shapes in the both samples, exhibiting a slight twisting for nano-leaves. Diffuse reflectance measurements reveal that the optical band-gap energies found for the ZnO nano-leaves and nano-rods is somewhat smaller than a wide-direct band gap of 3.37 eV. We argued that well defined and strong photoluminescence (PL) bands in the visible part that belong to the defects may influence the observed displacement of a ultraviolet (UV) near-band-edge emission, and which is related with obtained slightly lower band-gap energies than the established band gap of bulk ZnO. We discuss processes behind the multicolor UV/violet/blue/green/yellow emission band in PL spectra.},

Gold-polyaniline (Au-PANI) nanocomposite was prepared using a simple interfacial polymerization method, performed in an immiscible water/toluene biphasic system using tetrachloroaurate, AuCl 4 -  as an oxidant. The formation of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) or Au-PANI nanocomposite can be controlled to a certain degree by varying the ratio of initial Au +  and aniline concentrations. Under optimal condition (HAuCl 4 /aniline ratio is 1:2), green dispersion of Au-PANI nanocomposite is produced in aqueous phase, whose morphology,structure and physicochemical properties are investigated in details. The nanocomposite shows granular morphology with mostly rodlike AuNPs embedded in polymer. It was found that polyaniline in the composite is in the conducting emeraldine salt form, containing high amount of  Au (28.85 wt %). Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite was found to be four-fold higher than that of the polymer itself. In addition, the nanocomposite powder, isolated from the as-prepared aqueous dispersion, can later be easily redispersed in water and further used for various applications. Moreover, the obtained Au-PANI nanocomposite showed excellent electrocatalytic performance toward the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with high ORR onset potential and good selectivity. This makes it a promising candidate for a new class of Pt-free ORR catalyst.},

The synthesis method is based on the self-propagating, room-temperature reaction between metal nitrates and sodium hydroxide, and a subsequent calcination process. Series of samples were prepared with calcinations at various temperatures (600 °C, 800 °C and 1100 °C) for 1 h, and also with different Yb 3+ -Er 3+ ratios (10:1, 5:1 and 2:1). All calcined samples crystallized in a cubic bixbyite crystal phase with crystallite size from 12 to 44 nm in diameter, for samples calcined at 600 °C and 1100 °C, respectively. Different nanoparticle morphologies were obtained after calcinations on different temperatures; at temperatures under 1100 °C rod-like particles were obtained, while at 1100 °C spherical particles were formed. In all samples up-conversion emissions and corresponding lifetimes were measured after excitation in room temperature at 978 nm. The most intense emission originates from the characteristic intra-shell f-f electronic transitions of Er 3+ ions: [ 2 H 9/2 → 4 I 15/2 ] in blue (407-420 nm); [( 2 H 11/2 , 4 S 3/2 )→ 4 I 15/2 ] green: 510-590 nm; and [ 4 F 9/2 → 4 I 15/2 ] in red (640-720 nm) spectral regions.},

   abstract = {Composites consisting of polyaniline (PANI) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an average size of 17 and 30 nm were synthesized by an interfacial method performed in an immiscible water/toluene biphasic system. The effect of embedded AuNPs on the morphology, structure and physicochemical properties of Au/PANI nanocomposites was investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopies, UV-vis, FTIR, Raman and ICP-AES spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and conductivity measurements. Microscopy studies indicated nanofibrous morphology for pure PANI and Au/PANI nanocomposites, while FTIR and Raman spectroscopies were confirmed emeraldine salt form of PANI chains and the presence of phenazine units. Also, Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed an inherent structural inhomogeneity at the macromolecular level that exist in PANI chains in its pure form as well as in Au/PANI nanocomposites. In addition, the increase of the electrical conductivity observed in the nanocomposites was discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {<p>Given an unknown multicomponent alloy, and a set of standard compounds or alloys of known composition, can one improve upon popular standards-based methods for energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry to quantify the elemental composition of the unknown specimen? A method is presented here for determining elemental composition of alloys using transmission electron microscopy–based EDX with appropriate standards. The method begins with a discrete set of related reference standards of known composition, applies multivariate statistical analysis to those spectra, and evaluates the compositions with a linear matrix algebra method to relate the spectra to elemental composition. By using associated standards, only limited assumptions about the physical origins of the EDX spectra are needed. Spectral absorption corrections can be performed by providing an estimate of the foil thickness of one or more reference standards. The technique was applied to III-V multicomponent alloy thin films: composition and foil thickness were determined for various III-V alloys. The results were then validated by comparing with X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence analysis, demonstrating accuracy of approximately 1% in atomic fraction.</p>},

The presence of emeraldine salt and the base form of linear polyaniline (PANI) chains as well as the presence of phenazine units, branched PANI chains, oligomeric structures and short PANI chains in PANI/TiO 2 nanocomposites was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The anatase crystal structure of TiO 2 nanoparticles in all the nanocomposites was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction measurements and by Raman spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities of PANI/TiO 2 nanocomposites were evaluated using the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B and Methylene blue as model compounds and compared with the activity of bare colloidal TiO 2 nanoparticles. Enhanced degradation efficiencies in the dyes used were observed.

   abstract = {Platinized TiO 2 photocatalysts of different compositions of Pt 0 and PtO 2 were prepared by modifying the synthesis procedures. The physicochemical properties of the composite materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements confirmed the presence of Pt species existing as PtO 2 and/or mixtures of Pt 0 and PtO 2 . The composite material, Pt-TiO 2 -2%H, contained a high amount of metallic Pt 0 and PtO 2 in close proximity with TiO 2 that promoted an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under simulated solar light irradiation. Although Pt-TiO 2 -2%C and Pt-TiO 2 -2%T consisted of similar compositions of PtO 2 , these oxidized platinum species seem to appear further apart from TiO 2 in Pt-TiO 2 -2%C than Pt-TiO 2 -2%T. This caused dramatic variation in their optical behaviors such as strong fluorescence quenching and lower photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity in the former photocatalyst. A photocatalyst prepared by the conventional photodeposition method was also prepared, characterized, and its photocatalytic activity assessed. This work provides an opportunity to understand the role of PtO 2 for photocatalytic production of hydrogen from platinized TiO 2 composites and the importance of heterojunctions in such photocatalysts for solar energy conversion. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

UV-vis absorption measurements revealed that the optical band gap energies lay in the red part of the solar spectrum. The observed band gap energies, of nearly the same values (∼1.6 eV), proved that precursor concentrations and heating times had no effect on them. The structure refinement showed that the Sb 2 S 3 powder belonged to the orthorhombic type with a space group Pbnm. It was found that Sb 2 S 3 nanobars predominantly grew along the [010] direction, and that the unit cell parameters and the preferred orientation parameter (τ) refined against experimental data were quite dependent on both the precursor concentration and the heating time. The optimum heating time to nicely follow the dependence of structural parameters on the precursor concentration was observed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Solid-phase crystallization kinetics are examined during thermal annealing of as-deposited hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films deposited by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The influence of deposition temperature of HWCVD material on crystallization is also considered. Real-time observation of the crystallization process using in situ transmission electron microscope heating allowed tracking of the crystalline volume fraction and grain number density by image-processing methods. Beyond an initial incubation period, roughly constant grain nucleation rate and growth velocity are observed. Extrapolation from early stages of crystallization allows estimation of the final average grain sizes. PECVD material shows a much lower nucleation rate than does HWCVD material under the same annealing conditions, whereas the grain growth velocities are comparable, leading to dramatically larger grain sizes in PECVD material. X-ray diffraction line widths from PECVD material are broader compared to HWCVD material. The diffraction line broadening is primarily determined by intragranular defect structure, rather than grain size. Lowerature preannealing reduced the final XRD line widths of HWCVD material, indicating an influence on defect structure or density. Lattice contraction during crystallization of HWCVD material is observed to be independent of the initial hydrogen content. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We discuss compositional and structural transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization of lattice-mismatched (LMM) III-V epilayers grown on GaAs by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), with possible applications in high-efficiency multijunction solar cells. In addition to the use of TEM imaging to survey layer thicknesses and defect morphology, our analysis emphasizes the particular methods of energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED). Outlined here is a standards-based method for extracting compositions by EDX, which uses principal-component analysis (PCA) [1], combined with the zeta-factor approach of Watanabe and Williams [2] . A procedure is described that uses the coordinates of high-order Laue zone (HOLZ) lines, which are found in the bright-field disks of CBED patterns, to extract composition and strain parameters from embedded epilayers. The majority of the crystal growth for this work was performed at NREL, which has accommodated the development at SDSM & T of the characterization techniques described. However, epilayer deposition capability at SDSM & T has recently been achieved, using a home-built system, which is presently being used to examine new lattice-mismatched structures relevant to photovoltaic technology. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {InGaAs strain relaxation is studied by an in situ multibeam optical stress sensor (MOSS). Strain relaxation during growth of InGaAs on GaAs occurs at different thicknesses and rates along the directions perpendicular to its misfit dislocations, [110] and [1 1 0] . We show the asymmetry of relaxation between these directions in real time by aligning the MOSS laser array along [110] and [1 1 0] . This asymmetric relaxation data from the MOSS correlates with both x-ray diffraction relaxation analysis and an estimation of the misfit dislocation density from transmission electron microscopy images. Lowering the V/III ratio or raising the growth temperature lowers the thickness of the onset of dislocation formation, changes the relaxation rate, lowers the final relaxation during 2 μm of growth, and shifts the initial direction of relaxation from [110] to [1 1 0] . We identify two phases of relaxation that occur at different growth thicknesses. Lowering the V/III ratio changes the relative contribution of each of these phases to the total relaxation of the epilayer. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {<p>Utilizing the concepts of a critical crystallite size and local film inhomogeneity, it is shown that nucleation in thermally annealed hydrogenated amorphous silicon occurs in the more well ordered spatial regions in the network, which are defined by the initial inhomogeneous H distributions in the as‐grown films. Although the film H evolves very early during annealing, the local film order is largely retained in the still amorphous films even after the vast majority of the H is evolved, and the more well ordered regions which are the nucleation center sites for crystallization are those spatial regions which do not initially contain clustered H, as probed by H NMR spectroscopy. The sizes of these better ordered regions relative to a critical crystallite size determine the film incubation times (the time before the onset of crystallization). Changes in film short range order upon H evolution, and the presence of microvoid type structures in the as grown films play no role in the crystallization process. While the creation of dangling bonds upon H evolution may play a role in the actual phase transformation itself, the film defect densities measured just prior to the onset of crystallization exhibit no trends which can be correlated with the film incubation times.</p>},

Sodium chloride (NaCl) and dibasic sodium phosphate (Na <sub>2</sub> HPO <sub>4</sub> ·2H <sub>2</sub> O, DSP) separately or as mixture with different weight ratios were used as the salts. At the eutectic salt composition (20% DSP/80% NaCl), the microstructure and phase composition of the TiO <sub>2</sub> was changed from equiaxed nanoparticles of anatase with size ∼40–50 nm, to mixed microstructure of bundle and acicular particles of rutile with 0.05–0.2 μm diameter, 6–10 μm length, and aspect ratio 20–60 depending on treatment time and temperature. At high temperature (825°C) and long time (30 h), microstructural differences were significant for the powders treated with different salts. Particle morphologies ranged from equiaxed, to acicular, to bundles, to nanofibers with very high aspect ratio. At lower treatment temperature (725°C) for shorter time (3 h), the morphology of the products did not change with different salt compositions, but the crystallite sizes changed appreciably. Different starting titanium precursors influenced particle size at lower temperature and time. Titanium hydroxide heat treated without salt resulted in significant grain growth and fused secondary particles, as compared with more finely separated and lightly agglomerated powders resulting from SSS and MSS treatments. </bold> </p>},

Tomography reveals both cubic and hexagonal close‐packing configurations in multi‐layered arrays of size‐selected In nanospheres. By tomography and phase‐contrast lattice imaging, we relate the three‐dimensional shape of PbSe octahedral nanoparticles to the underlying crystal structure. We also confirm simple‐cubic packing in multi‐layers of PbSe nanocubes and see evidence that the particle shapes have cubic symmetry.

The material was annealed at 600°C and 630°C for variable times to achieve various degrees of crystallinity. The films thickness of 100-nm allowed characterization by TEM without additional thinning. The grain growth in such thin films is nearly two-dimensional, allowing clear identification of crystalline and amorphous regions. Thus, the crystalline volume fraction can be tracked by simple image-processing methods. The evolution of crystallization by grain nucleation and growth for these films is accurately described by classical phase-change kinetics. Analysis of the randomly distributed grains at early stages of crystallization also provides the average areal grain number density and grain size. From the image analysis, we determine the grain nucleation rate and the grain growth velocity. The final grain size is then estimated by extrapolation to the fully crystallized state, assuming the kinetic parameters remain constant after the onset of crystallization.</p>},

However, other sources of XRD line broadening exist in such materials in addition to crystallite size, including the density of crystallite defects. To address these issues, TEM measurements have also been performed on a-Si:H films deposited directly onto TEM grids. Following the procedure of Iverson and Reif (J. Appl. Phys. 62 (1987) 1675), an examination of films with low grain density enables a determination of the crystallite nucleation rate as well as grain growth rate. We compare the results for HWCVD films of different film C H , and also for HWCVD and PECVD a-Si:H films containing the same initial film C H . We also perform Raman measurements on fully crystallized HWCVD films to explore whether film disorder plays a role in the different XRD FWHMs when different amounts of film hydrogen are evolved. © 2006 IEEE.},

They also show that elongated semiconductors that grow on metallic catalysts have electronic properties that are different from those of pure semiconductor nanocrystals of the same shape. We have also developed a simple method for growing melted indium particles on the surface of colloidal spherical InP nanocrystals, and in these In/InP nanocrystals the emission is completely quenched while the absorption spectrum moves to red due to the strong mixing of the semiconductor and metal electronic states. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

The synthetic protocol described here avoids the need for covalent chemical modification of carbon nanotube (CNT) surfaces. Specifically, InP quantum dots (QDs) and CdSe QDs were found to strongly adsorb onto the surfaces of carbon single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) by gentle heating in organic solvents. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the semiconductor nanocrystal (NC) / SWNT assemblies, and revealed that the surfaces of the SWNT bundles template the adsorption of the NCs from solution. Small QDs were found to randomly absorb onto SWNTs, while larger QDs self-assembled into long linear chains. The nature of binding and ordering was investigated by simply considering van der Waals (vdW) forces for both NC-SWNT and NC-NC interactions. Quantum rods (QRs) were also found to adsorb along the nanotube surfaces. These findings have important implications for the synthesis of NC / SWNT hybrid nanostructures.</p>},

   abstract = {We demonstrate the formation, and the electronic and optical properties of a novel type of semiconductor superlattice in spontaneously ordered GalnP alloys. The most frequently observed ordered structure in MOCVD grown GalnP has CuPt symmetry where the ordering directions occur in the two [lll]s directions, corresponding to two distinct ordered variants. A new type of superlattice, termed an orientational superlattice, emerges as the ordered domains are stacked in a sequence whereby the ordering direction switches alternatively from the [ 1 11]  direction in one domain to the [1 1 1] direction in the next domain. The novelty of this type of superlattice lies in that there is neither a band-gap nor an effective mass discontinuity along the superlattice axis. When the GalnP epilayer is grown on an exact (001) or [111U tilt GaAs substrate, the two ordered variants are equally favorable. Thus, ordered domain twins appear in ordered GalnP epilayers. We present a comparitive study between the single-variant ordered structure and the double-variant ordered superlattice structure, using TEM and time-resolved differential absorption. We show that for a same order parameter, the band-gap of an orientational superlattice is higher than that of a single-variant ordered structure, and the in-plane optical anisotropy between the [1 10]  and [110] directions is greatly enhanced due to the superlattice effect. The experimental results are explained in terms of the band structure of the orientational superlattice. © 2000 Materials Research Society.},

We have grown cis epitaxial films on single-crystal GaAs substrates under conditions that enhance the influence of surface effects on the resulting structures and their properties. There is a pronounced morphological dichotomy between indium-rich and copper-rich films. In addition, epilayers with nominally identical compositions and morphologies can exhibit fundamentally different ordering of the lattice in either the equilibrium chalcopyrite (CH) or metastable CuAu (CA) structure. The addition of sodium to In-rich CuInSe 2 epilayers during the initial stages of epitaxy both suppresses the formation of metastable CA-CuInSe 2 and dramatically changes the film morphology. We discuss these results in the context of recent theories of island nucleation and our hypothesis that sodium acts as a surfactant during the growth of CuInSe 2 by destabilizing the (In Cu + 2 V Cu ) defect-associate-complex in the near-surface transition layer, rejecting excess indium from the bulk of the growing film.},

   abstract = {<p> We demonstrate the formation, and the electronic and optical properties of a novel type of semiconductor superlattice in spontaneously ordered GaInP alloys. The most frequently observed ordered structure in MOCVD grown GaInP has CuPt symmetry where the ordering directions occur in the two [111] <sub>B</sub> directions, corresponding to two distinct ordered variants. A new type of superlattice, termed an orientational superlattice, emerges as the ordered domains are stacked in a sequence whereby the ordering direction switches alternatively from the [ <overline>1</overline> 11] direction in one domain to the [1 <overline>1</overline> 1] direction in the next domain. The novelty of this type of superlattice lies in that there is neither a band-gap nor an effective mass discontinuity along the superlattice axis. When the GaInP epilayer is grown on an exact (001) or [111] <sub>A</sub> tilt GaAs substrate, the two ordered variants are equally favorable. Thus, ordered domain twins appear in ordered GaInP epilayers. We present a comparitive study between the single-variant ordered structure and the double-variant ordered superlattice structure, using TEM and time-resolved differential absorption. We show that for a same order parameter, the band-gap of an orientational superlattice is higher than that of a single-variant ordered structure, and the in-plane optical anisotropy between the [ <overline>1</overline> 10] and [110] <sub>B</sub> directions is greatly enhanced due to the superlattice effect. The experimental results are explained in terms of the band structure of the orientational superlattice. </p>},

The use of x-ray diffraction, TEM, AFM, and STEM to characterize the modulations is discussed. Combining the information from these techniques gives increased insight into the phenomenon and how to manipulate it. Diffraction measures the intensity of modulation and its wavelength, and is used to identify growth conditions giving strong modulation. The TEM and STEM analyses indicate that local compositions are modulated by as much as 0.38 InAs mole fraction. Plan-view images show that modulated structures consists of short (≳0.2 μm) In-rich wires with a 2D organization in a (001) growth plane. However, growth on miscut substrates can produce a single modulation along the miscut direction with much longer wires (≲0.4 μm), as desired for potential applications. Photoluminescence studies demonstrate that the modulation has large effects on the bandgap energy of the superlattice.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In the last ten years, the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has become capable of forming electron probes of atomic dimensions making possible a new approach to high-resolution electron microscopy, Z-contrast imaging. Formed by mapping the intensity of high-angle scattered electrons as the probe is scanned across the specimen, the Z-contrast image represents a direct map of the specimen scattering power at atomic resolution. It is an incoherent image, and can be directly interpreted in terms of atomic columns. High angle scattering comes predominantly from the atomic nuclei, so the scattering cross section depends on atomic number (Z) squared. Z-contrast microscopy can therefore be used to study compositional ordering and segregation at the atomic scale. Here we present three examples of ordering: first, ferroelectric materials, second, III-V semiconductor alloys, and finally, cooperative segregation at a semiconductor grain boundary, where a combination of Z-contrast imaging with first principles theory provides a complete atomic-scale view of the sites and configurations of the segregant atoms.</p>},

The GaN particles were separated, purified, and partially dispersed in a nonpolar solvent to yield transparent colloidal solutions that consisted of individual GaN particles. The GaNnanocrystals have a spherical shape and mean diameter of about 30±12 Å. The spectroscopic behavior of colloidal transparent dispersion has been investigated and shows that the band gap of the GaNnanocrystals shifts to slightly higher energy due to quantum confinement. The photoluminescencespectrum at 10 K (excited at 310 nm) shows band edge emission with several emission peaks in the range between 3.2 and 3.8 eV, while the photoluminescence excitation spectrum shows two excited-state transitions at higher energies.},

Low-injection lifetimes of several ms are measured in double-variant ordered samples at 77 K; these lifetimes decrease rapidly with temperatures above 180 K, giving a thermal activation energy for recombination of 0.19 eV. Single-variant ordered samples exhibit typical lifetimes of 30-60 μs, with no noticeable temperature dependence up to 300 K. Charge separation in double-variant samples may be driven by a type-II band alignment between ordered and disordered regions, or by an alternating internal electrical polarization between ordered variants.

   abstract = {<p>The application of III-V semiconductor alloys in device structures is of importance for high-speed microelectronics and optoelectronics. These alloys have allowed the device engineer to tailor material parameters such as the bandgap and carrier mobility to the need of the device by altering the alloy composition. When using ternary or quaternary materials, the device designer presumes that the alloy is completely disordered, without any correlation between the atoms on the cation (anion) sublattice. However the thermodynamics of the alloy system often produce material that has some degree of macroscopic or microscopic ordering. Short-range ordering occurs when atoms adopt correlated neighboring positions over distances of the order of a few lattice spacings. This can be manifested as the preferential association of like atoms, as in clustering, or of unlike atoms, as in chemical ordering (e.g., CuPt ordering). Long-range ordering occurs over many tens of lattice spacings, as in the case of phase separation. In either short-range or long-range ordering, the band structure and the crystal symmetry are greatly altered. Therefore it is absolutely critical that the mechanisms be fully understood to prevent ordering when necessary or to exploit it when possible.</p>},

   abstract = {As germanium is closed lattice matched to GaAs, it a suitable substrate for epitaxial growth. In the quest for inexpensive substrates, thin-film Ge grown on glass is an attractive candidate if suitable grain growth can be achieved. Here we will describe Ge films that are deposited by an e-beam evaporator on glass and are approximately 2000 angstroms thick. The films were annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C to improve the quality of the material. The growth was done in three steps with 1000 angstroms of Ge, 70 angstroms of Sb, and followed by another 1000 angstroms of Ge. Sb is an n-type dopant in Ge and is included to enhance grain growth. The best films contained the Sb layer and hole concentrations between 1.4×10 15 to 1.6×10 17 cm -3 . The largest hole mobility measured was 30.6 cm 2 /Vs in the 1.4×10 15 p-type sample. The electron lifetime was measured by ultra-high frequency photoconductive decay and the best lifetimes were in the 30- to 40-ns range. Scanning-electron microscope and transmission-electron microscope studies indicated a polycrystalline grain structure with grain size comparable to the film thickness.},

Ultra-high frequency photoconductivity decay is used to measure carrier lifetimes in ordered and disordered material following excitation with a YAG laser. Ordered material shows an extended lifetime of 18-186 μs that decreases with incident power. Strongly ordered material showed two CuPt-B subvariants in TEM diffraction patterns and images. Ordering in the first 0.5 μm of growth consists of a fine, interwoven structure with the subvariants closely associated. The subvariants then segregate into imperfectly ordered columnar superdomains that form a mosaic in the film plane with numerous order/order interfaces. In addition, order/disorder interfaces form within and adjacent to the partially ordered superdomains. We attribute the extended transient photoconductivity lifetime in ordered samples to trapping effects that result from the subvariant domain structure.},

Transmission electron microscopy images show distinct composition modulation appearing as vertical regions of In- and Al-rich materials alternating in the [110] projection. The periodicity of the modulation is 130 Å, and is asymmetric. The transmission electron and x-ray diffraction patterns from the structure exhibit distinct satellite spots which correspond to the lateral periodicity. Transmission electron microscopy images show that the individual superlattice layers possess cusplike undulations, which directly correlate with the composition modulation.

The first technique calculates the diffraction pattern of ordered material quantitatively and fits the calculated data to experimentally obtained data. A test sample, specifically grown for this technique, shows that the method can determine the average order parameter with high accuracy. We found an order parameter of 0.34, which coincides with the value found by piezo-reflectance measurements. To measure the order parameter on a smaller length scale, we use a technique based on image processing of high-resolution TEM images. By comparing ordered and disordered parts of the image, we calculate the relative order parameter on an atomic length scale. Analyzing the data provides information about the development of the ordering in the crystal.</p>},

Transmission electron microscopy images of samples grown on four degree-tilted substrates showed superlattice-like structures, with periods in the range 13.4-28.9Â. Lattice images reveal diffuse interfaces between light and dark bands. Period variations were detected in isolated regions of some samples. We present evidence that the modulation develops at the growth surface, and remains stable in the bulk at temperatures up to 450°C. Satellite spot pairs with approximate indices (h k 1 + δ) were present near the zinc-blende spots in electron diffraction patterns and x-ray diffraction data, as expected from material with a sinusoidal composition profile. The orientation of the spots reveals that the modulation vector is parallel to the growth direction, rather than to [001] . The [111]A- and B-tilted samples showed significant modulation, while the five degree-[110] and on-axis material showed no detectable modulation. The modulation wavelength did not strongly depend on growth temperature in the range examined (285-335°C). Samples showing composition modulation did not exhibit significantly altered low-temperature luminescence spectra from material with no modulation. © 1995 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.},

   abstract = {Single crystal x-ray diffraction was used to study phase transitions in layered materials
resulting from intercalation processes. Na vermiculite samples in the 0-, 1-, and 2-water layer
hydration states (WLHSs) were examined. Buerger precession photographs revealed the
formation of a (2a x 2b) superlattice (a=5.35, b~9.30 A) specfic to samples in the 1-WLHS.
Previous Raman scattering experiments indicated that samples in the 1-WLHS may exhibit an inplane zone-folded phonon. The lattice constant doubling of the in-plane structure is attributed to
an ordering of the intercalated cations in the interlamellar space. Hydration states were confirmed
by well-established c-axis lattice constants.
High-Tc superconducting YBa2Cu3 0 7 -* (YBCO) samples with 0< x<1 were studied for
structural characteristics. Tetragonal samples (x>0.6) were examined in high-pressure O2
enviroments at ambient temperature using diamond anvil cells (DACs). High pressure was
maintained for several weeks while in-plane lattice constants were monitored. The cell was heated
at 180°C for 3 hours during the analysis. Some splitting of the in-plane Bragg peaks occurred
during the pressure cycle, and is perhaps related to a fracturing of the sample under stress. The
sample exhibited some change in the c-axis lattice constant after the procedure, indicating
possible oxygen intercalation. Raman scattering experiments showed similar results.
High-Tc superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu20s+x (BSCCO) single crystal samples were
intercalated with iodine by heating at 150°-200°C for several days to produce a stage -1
compound. The expansion of the IBi2Sr2CaCu2C>8+x (IBSCCO) compound in the temperature
range 20°C-100°C was monitored. No phase transition to a higher staged compound was
observed. The IBSCCO samples exhibited similar in-plane structure to the BSCCO samples, with
b“5a=27.0 A. Raman experiments revealed the presence of molecular iodine.

The transitions between the hydration states were found to be first order, evidenced by a two-phase coexistence and large hysteresis. Substantial elastic deformation, which involves rotations of the tetragonal bases in the host silicate layers, was observed during the transitions. It was concluded that elastic distortion in the host layers may be responsible for the hydration phase transitions. In addition, formation of a (2a×2b) superlattice specific to the 1-WLHS was found.
